        Monas, short for "Monumen Nasional" (National Monument), is an iconic symbol of Indonesia's independence and pride. Located in the heart of Jakarta, this towering structure stands at 132 meters and is crowned by a gold-coated flame, representing the spirit of freedom.

        Construction of Monas began in 1961 under President Sukarno's administration and was completed in 1975. The monument is surrounded by the Merdeka Square, a large park often used for public gatherings and events.
